# Background

* Research on same-sex sexual behaviour in primates is focussed in few species (e.g. bonobos, *Pan paniscus*, and Japanese macaques, *Macaca fuscata*: Vasey, 2007)

* Few reports on same-sex sexual behaviour in some taxa may be due to lack of expression, but could also represent methodological or practical challenges, such as when:
  + Behaviours are difficult to observe, for example in arboreal, cryptic, or nocturnal species (Ramsay & Teichroeb, 2019)
  + Species are not represented in captivity (Ramsay & Teichroeb, 2019)
  + Behaviours have been observed but have not been published (Anderson et al., Submitted)

* Same-sex sexual behaviour has recently been reported in *Colobus* *vellerosus* (Teichroeb et al., 2023), but no reports are available for other black-and-white colobus species

* **Here, I report for the first time observations of same-sex sexual behaviour in *Colobus* *angolensis* *ruwenzorii* **

# Methods

Data were collected during a three-month field season from May 2022 - August 2022 in the Manwa Forest Reserve (~280ha) near Lake Nabugabo, Masaka District, Uganda. Follows occurred from 8:00 to 16:00 each day, alternating between three focal core units consisting of multiple males and multiple females. Scan samples of all group members behaviour were taken every 15 minutes, and 10-minute focal animal samples were be collected from each adult and subadult between scans. All observations of sexual behaviour were recorded as they were seen (Altmann, 1974). 

# Definitions

Same-sex sexual behaviour is typically defined as genital contact or manipulation between members of the same sex (Vasey, 1995). As sexual behaviour often includes a sequence of behaviour before and after genital contact (Enomoto, 1974), these were also considered. Within *C. a. ruwenzorii* these behaviours can include:

* **Presenting for sex:** Sexual solicitation involving positioning hips towards another and lifting hips in the air

* **Hip grab:** Usually following a sexual solicitation, the solicitee grabs the hips of the solicitor and positions themselves behind them

* **Mounting:** When one individual mounts another

```{r, fig.align = "center"}

```


# Results
**Table 1** Observations of same-sex sexual behaviour
```{r mytable, out.width='90%'}
html <- knitr::kable(data,align = 'c',"html")
kable_styling(html, font_size = 50)
```



* **Four events of same-sex sexual behaviour were observed** during the three-month field season (described in Table 1)

* Two events involved sexual solicitation without mounting or ejaculation (1, 4)

* Two events involved mounting (2, 3)

* One event was between females (2), while the other three events were between males (1, 3, 4)

# Discussion

* These observations of same-sex sexual behaviour in *C. a. ruwenzorii* provide evidence that same-sex sexual behaviour occurs among both sexes in this species, as reported in other black-and-white colobus (Teichroeb et al., 2023)

* Same-sex sexual behaviour occurred most frequently in adult males, similar to reports in *C. vellerosus,* but this trend may change with more data

* Sequences of behaviour generally followed the same sequence observed in opposite-sex sexual behaviour (approach and present, followed by either mounting or grooming)


# Conclusion

Given the lack of data on same-sex sexual behaviour in black-and-white colobus, it is difficult to conclude on the evolutionary or functional significance of this behaviour. However, there is now evidence that same-sex sexual behaviour occurs in at least two black-and-white colobus species. More reporting on same-sex sexual behaviour in African colobines would improve our ability to:

* Draw evolutionary and functional conclusions

* Conduct meta-analyses

* Increase the strength of phylogenetic analysis
